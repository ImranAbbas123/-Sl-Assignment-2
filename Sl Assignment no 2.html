<h1>Difference between Let,var and Const</h1>
<ul >
<font size="+2">
<li>	var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
</li>
<li>	var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
</li>
<li>	They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while varvariables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
	</li>
<li>	While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
</li>
